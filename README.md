# RPG-Battle
CAUTION! This is my very first project, it's in no way near perfect.
NOTE: All the files in this repository are required to run the program.
This is a basic layout for a simple text based game in which multiple party members play against 3 enemies.
They can use basic skills like attacking, healing, and using magic and much more. 
The enemy plays with a fixed but relaible strategy which may change game to game depending upon your gameplay.
